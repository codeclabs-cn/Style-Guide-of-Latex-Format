\chapter{C++ Version}\label{ch:c++-version}
Currently, code should target C++17, i.e., should not use C++2x features, with the exception of \hyperref[sec:designated-initializers]{designated initializers}. The C++ version targeted by this guide will advance (aggressively) over time.

Do not use \hyperref[sec:nonstandard-extensions]{non-standard extensions}.

Consider portability to other environments before using features from C++14 and C++17 in your project.
