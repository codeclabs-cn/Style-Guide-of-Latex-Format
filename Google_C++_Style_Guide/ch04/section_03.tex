\section{Nonmember, Static Member, and Global Functions}\label{sec:nonmember-static-member-and-global-functions}
Prefer placing nonmember functions in a namespace; use completely global functions rarely. Do not use a class simply to group static members. Static methods of a class should generally be closely related to instances of the class or the class's static data.

\subsection{Pros}
Nonmember and static member functions can be useful in some situations. Putting nonmember functions in a namespace avoids polluting the global namespace.

\subsection{Cons}
Nonmember and static member functions may make more sense as members of a new class, especially if they access external resources or have significant dependencies.

\subsection{Decision}
Sometimes it is useful to define a function not bound to a class instance. Such a function can be either a static member or a nonmember function. Nonmember functions should not depend on external variables, and should nearly always exist in a namespace. Do not create classes only to group static members; this is no different than just giving the names a common prefix, and such grouping is usually unnecessary anyway.

If you define a nonmember function and it is only needed in its \mintinline[breakanywhere,bgcolor=code_bg_pro]{C++}{.cc} file, use \hyperref[sec:internal-linkage]{internal linkage} to limit its scope.
