Use \mintinline[breakanywhere,bgcolor=code_bg_pro]{Text}{cpplint.py} to detect style errors.

\mintinline[breakanywhere,bgcolor=code_bg_pro]{Text}{cpplint.py} is a tool that reads a source file and identifies many style errors. It is not perfect, and has both false positives and false negatives, but it is still a valuable tool.

Some projects have instructions on how to run \mintinline[breakanywhere,bgcolor=code_bg_pro]{Text}{cpplint.py} from their project tools. If the project you are contributing to does not, you can download \href{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/styleguide/gh-pages/cpplint/cpplint.py}{cpplint.py} separately.
