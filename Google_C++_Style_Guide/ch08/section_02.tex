\section{Friends}\label{sec:friends}
We allow use of \mintinline[breakanywhere,bgcolor=code_bg_pro]{C++}{friend} classes and functions, within reason.

Friends should usually be defined in the same file so that the reader does not have to look in another file to find uses of the private members of a class. A common use of \mintinline[breakanywhere,bgcolor=code_bg_pro]{C++}{friend} is to have a \mintinline[breakanywhere,bgcolor=code_bg_pro]{C++}{FooBuilder} class be a friend of \mintinline[breakanywhere,bgcolor=code_bg_pro]{C++}{Foo} so that it can construct the inner state of \mintinline[breakanywhere,bgcolor=code_bg_pro]{C++}{Foo} correctly, without exposing this state to the world. In some cases it may be useful to make a unittest class a friend of the class it tests.

Friends extend, but do not break, the encapsulation boundary of a class. In some cases this is better than making a member public when you want to give only one other class access to it. However, most classes should interact with other classes solely through their public members.
