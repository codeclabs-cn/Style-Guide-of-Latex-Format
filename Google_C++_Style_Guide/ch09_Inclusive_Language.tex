\chapter{Inclusive Language}\label{ch:inclusive-language}

In all code, including naming and comments, use inclusive language and avoid terms that other programmers might find disrespectful or offensive (such as \enquote{master} and \enquote{slave}, \enquote{blacklist} and \enquote{whitelist}, or \enquote{redline}), even if the terms also have an ostensibly neutral meaning. Similarly, use gender-neutral language unless you're referring to a specific person (and using their pronouns). For example, use \enquote{they}/\enquote{them}/\enquote{their} for people of unspecified gender (\hyperref[ch:singular-they]{even when singular}), and \enquote{it}/\enquote{its} for software, computers, and other things that aren't people.
