\section{File Comments}\label{sec:file-comments}
Start each file with license boilerplate.

File comments describe the contents of a file. If a file declares, implements, or tests exactly one abstraction that is documented by a comment at the point of declaration, file comments are not required. All other files must have file comments.

    \subsection{Legal Notice and Author Line}
    Every file should contain license boilerplate. Choose the appropriate boilerplate for the license used by the project (for example, Apache 2.0, BSD, LGPL, GPL).

    If you make significant changes to a file with an author line, consider deleting the author line. New files should usually not contain copyright notice or author line.
    \subsection{File Contents}
    If a \mintinline[breakanywhere,bgcolor=code_bg_pro]{C++}{.h} declares multiple abstractions, the file-level comment should broadly describe the contents of the file, and how the abstractions are related. A 1 or 2 sentence file-level comment may be sufficient. The detailed documentation about individual abstractions belongs with those abstractions, not at the file level.

    Do not duplicate comments in both the \mintinline[breakanywhere,bgcolor=code_bg_pro]{C++}{.h} and the \mintinline[breakanywhere,bgcolor=code_bg_pro]{C++}{.cc}. Duplicated comments diverge.
